Notable changes since last release ([v1.6.2703](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.6.2703))

- **Added**: A new mini-mod that replaces the default premade characters and changes their starting equipment accordingly.
- **Fixed**: It wasn't possible to bust Iguana Bob after taking down Decker, because the Sheriff's dialog would change to a floating text. Now it will turn into a regular dialog if the player knows about Bob.
- **Fixed**: The Combat Shotgun (Ext. Mag) was set as 1-handed weapon.
