Notable changes since last release ([v1.4.2228](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.4.2228))
- **Added**: The "Tougher Mutants"-setting works as a multiplier now. 1 is the prefered setting, 2 is still okay, but everything above slowly moves into some serious OVERKILL-territory.
- **Fixed**: If the player takes the Gun Runner guns as reward, Razor would not react to it accordingly.
