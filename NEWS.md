Notable changes since last release ([v1.4.2228](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.4.2228))

- **Added**: Party members will float random text if they have a crippled limb or are posioned (inspired by Fo2 Unofficial Patch / Restoration Project).
- **Added**: The "Tougher Mutants"-setting works as a multiplier now. 1 is the prefered setting, 2 is still okay, but everything above slowly moves into some serious OVERKILL-territory.
- **Fixed**: If the player takes the Gun Runner guns as reward, Razor would not react to it accordingly.
- **Fixed**: The Watershed mutants would not leave the map on the correct path. Also added a check to remove them from the map if the player leaves before they walked off-screen.
- **Fixed**: The relationship dialog between Trish and Saul has been fixed up and somewhat polished (old restored cut content). Required new dialog lines to be added.
