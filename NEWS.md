Notable changes since last release ([v1.3.2128](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.3.2128))
- **Added**: All classic music tracks are now distributed with the mod, because it seems lots of folks have issues with setting it up correctly.
- **Fixed**: A critical bug in the encounter system that would crash the game.
- **Fixed**: Added missing "Combat Armor"-perk to Combat Armor and Brotherhood Armor.
- **Fixed**: After being brought to Mariposa by Super Mutants, party members would not be moved correctly into the prison cell.
- **Fixed**: Empty encounters should (hopefully) not happen anymore now. 
- **Fixed**: For some reason the brown bag used the normal bag graphics. Also tweaked the item stats to slightly differentiate it from the normal bag.
- **Fixed**: Hero Appearance mod long hair dude pipboy image wasn't shown correctly.
- **Fixed**: Killian wouldn't mark Necropolis on the players map after asking for locations outside. 
- **Fixed**: The "You gain x experience points for freeing Tandi"-message will only show if the amount of experience is > 0.
- **Fixed**: When doing caravan jobs, the Caravan Driver and Caravan Guards would spawn new items on every game tick.
- **Tweaked**: Added back in the "Decker must be killed"-condition to the Hub good ending.
- **Tweaked**: Removed excess items (stimpaks, psycho, caps, etc) from Garl (was a Fixt addition that changed game balance).
- **Tweaked**: Sfall graphics mode 4 (Dx9 fullscreen) is now the new default.
- **Tweaked**: With Traits and Perks and the enabled "Fast Shot Fix", it was possible to get 1 AP melee and unarmed attacks. This is now fixed - the minimum APs required for any attack are now set to 2.
