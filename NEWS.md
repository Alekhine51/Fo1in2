Notable changes since last release ([v1.3.2128](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.3.2128))
- **Added**: All classic music tracks are now distributed with the mod, because it seems lots of folks have issues with setting it up correctly.
- **Fixed**: Hero Appearance mod long hair dude pipboy image wasn't shown correctly.
- **Fixed**: Killian wouldn't mark Necropolis on the players map after asking for locations outside. 
- **Tweaked**: Added back in the "Decker must be killed"-condition to the Hub good ending.
- **Tweaked**: Sfall graphics mode 4 (Dx9 fullscreen) is now the new default.
- **Tweaked**: With Traits and Perks and the enabled "Fast Shot Fix", it was possible to get 1 AP melee and unarmed attacks. This is now fixed - the minimum APs required for any attack are now set to 2.
