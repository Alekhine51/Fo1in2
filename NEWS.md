Notable changes since last release ([v1.3.2128](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.3.2128))
- **Fixed**: Hero Appearance mod long hair dude pipboy image wasn't shown correctly.
- **Tweaked**: With Traits and Perks and the enabled "Fast Shot Fix", it was possible to get 1 AP melee and unarmed attacks. This is now fixed - the minimum APs required for any attack are now set to 2.
