Notable changes since last release ([v1.2.2035](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.2.2035))
- **Added**: Fallout 2's Metal Armor Mk2 has a small chance to spawn at the Gunrunners now, because why not.
- **Added**: New text to Razor in the Boneyard, to remove some of the really shitty repeating dialog states.
- **Fixed**: "Knocking out" the raider in Marcelle's Crash House won't trigger the "you killed him"-dialog anymore.
- **Fixed**: Armor destroy mod had wrong conditions set ...
- **Fixed**: Blades would not join the attack on Adytum if the player attacks the Regulators on his own after telling Razor "let me speak with Zimmerman first" (example: due to player not having the Holodisk to show Zimmerman).
- **Fixed**: Killian in Junktown would restock his money on every map_enter if he doesn't have any in his inventory.
- **Fixed**: Lorenzo in the Hub had a typo in his move order, which would send him outside (vanilla Fo1 bug).
- **Fixed**: Miles in Adytum would GIVE the player 1.000 caps when making a hardened power armor, not TAKE it from the player.
- **Fixed**: Miles in Adytum would spend +6 hours (reading the science books) when hardening every power armor, not just the first.
- **Fixed**: Razor would not move to the Adytum entrance after the Blades attacked without the help of the player.
- **Fixed**: Seth in Shady Sands still had a dialog option to teleport the player to the radscorpion caves, even with the satellite locations feature enabled.
- **Fixed**: Survivalist perk now correctly gives +20% Outdoorsman skill on each of its 3 ranks.
- **Fixed**: The Master now uses his correct critical hit tables.
- **Fixed**: The Necropolis invasion would still happen after killing Harry and his friends, even though it was disabled (set to 0) in the fo1_settings.ini file.
- **Tweaked**: Changed the conditions for the "good" Hub ending slide to be more in line with the information on the Wiki (complete "find the missing caravans", don't finish any of Decker's quests, be friendly with Harold). Skipped Iguana Bob, though, because it's too random right now. Also Jain is a bit of an exception - she can be killed as long as the player didn't get the job from Decker.
- **Tweaked**: Katja will now gain a few % of lockpick skill per level up.
- **Tweaked**: Killing Vance in the Hub now gives "neutral" reputation instead of "bad".
- **Tweaked**: Lorenzo in the Hub has a more lenient loan timeout now (4 hours instead of 24).
- **Tweaked**: Lowered the requirements a bit to turn in Iguana Bob to the Sheriff.
- **Tweaked**: Re-enabled attack animations when using punching bag scenery objects (overrides the "use" animation).
- **Tweaked**: Reduced Mauser ammo on Gizmo back to 20 bullets (reverted Fixt change).
- **Tweaked**: Removed Stimpaks from Gizmo (reverted Fixt change).
- **Tweaked**: The Shady Sands merchant is now disabled by default.
- **Tweaked**: Wu in the Cathedral is selling his emblem again (alternative path to get the key).
