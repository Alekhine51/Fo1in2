Notable changes since last release ([v1.4.2228](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.4.2228))

- **Added**: A new caps modifier to reduce the amount of currency on the merchants a bit.
- **Added**: Party members will float random text if they have a crippled limb or are posioned (inspired by Fo2 Unofficial Patch / Restoration Project).
- **Added**: Setting off the trap on Hightower's strongbox will now trigger his guard to investigate.
- **Added**: The "Tougher Mutants"-setting works as a multiplier now. 1 is the prefered setting, 2 is still okay, but everything above slowly moves into some serious OVERKILL-territory.
- **Added**: The Mariposa force field emitter will now be correctly destroyed (visually) if the Mr. Handy robot crashes into it.
- **Added**: There is now a low chance for cavern encounters to not spawn any mobs at all.
- **Added**: Trying to destroy a force field emitter but failing to do so will now show up accordingly in the message log.
- **Fixed**: Brotherhood Paladins in encounter maps would not recognize the player as an Initiate.
- **Fixed**: Darrel at the Brotherhood now correctly shows his secondary "look at"-description text.
- **Fixed**: Dialog with the guard to the Master's Lair could crash the game.
- **Fixed**: Hightower's strongbox was missing a blocking hex.
- **Fixed**: If the player takes the Gun Runner guns as reward, Razor would not react to it accordingly.
- **Fixed**: If the player used the dynamite-exploit to kill Killian, the Junktown guards wouldn't react to it.
- **Fixed**: In a city encounter map it was possible for random encounter mobs to spawn inside objects.
- **Fixed**: Main door in the Raiders map had a blocker missing (could still walk through a closed door).
- **Fixed**: Radio proto didn't have the radio-script attached, thus only very few (map placed) radios in the game could be used at Mariposa.
- **Fixed**: Talking to Calder at the Cathedral entrance while having the Childkiller-reputation would show the wrong dialog node.
- **Fixed**: The 2nd guard to the Master's Lair was spawning an "ERROR" dialog.
- **Fixed**: The Broterhood lower levels would not correctly disable after mutants invaded the location (it was possible to enter the maps via Town/World button).
- **Fixed**: The Light Step perk wasn't working on mines.
- **Fixed**: The Master's Lair terminal that would mark Mariposa on the worldmap would sometimes not mark the location on the worldmap.
- **Fixed**: The Skum Pitt and V13 armory door would reset when loading a savegame.
- **Fixed**: The Watershed mutants would not leave the map on the correct path. Also added a check to remove them from the map if the player leaves before they walked off-screen.
- **Fixed**: The dynamite-exploit won't work on crucial NPCs anymore (Beth, Jacob, Zack, Razor, ...).
- **Fixed**: The relationship dialog between Trish and Saul has been fixed up and somewhat polished (old restored cut content). Required new dialog lines to be added.
- **Tweaked**: When walking through the "revulse tunnel" in the Master's Lair, the party member damage information will now run before the players to not spam the message log so much.
