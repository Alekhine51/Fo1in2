Notable changes since last release ([v1.3.2128](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.3.2128))
- **Added**: A new setting to enable tougher Super Mutants for a more challenging endgame.
- **Added**: After killing the Deathclaws in the Boneyard, the player can now pay Zack to increase the chance of spawning special weapons (only works if Fo2-style merchant inventory restocking is enabled).
- **Added**: All classic music tracks are now distributed with the mod, because it seems lots of folks have issues with setting it up correctly.
- **Added**: Carrying a rope will now prevent the player from breaking his bones in "cliff" encounters (item will be consumed).
- **Added**: Garret in Necropolis will now open/close the "reward fridge" when using it. Also added the missing "locked container" sfx.
- **Added**: Lots of invisible blockers around edges in cavern map to try to prevent the game from spawning mobs outside the walls.
- **Added**: The HK P90 ("10mm Carbine") has a small chance to appear at the Gun Runners now.
- **Fixed**: A critical bug in the encounter system that would crash the game.
- **Fixed**: Added missing "Combat Armor"-perk to Combat Armor and Brotherhood Armor.
- **Fixed**: After being brought to Mariposa by Super Mutants, party members would not be moved correctly into the prison cell.
- **Fixed**: After opening the armory, the guard will return correctly to his home position and rotation.
- **Fixed**: Caps restocking was broken on some merchants.
- **Fixed**: Dogmeat will now start out correctly with 50hp.
- **Fixed**: Empty encounters should (hopefully) not happen anymore now. 
- **Fixed**: Encounter Super Mutants with Laser Rifles will now spawn with MFCs instead of SECs (vanilla Fo1 bug).
- **Fixed**: For some reason the brown bag used the normal bag graphics. Also tweaked the item stats to slightly differentiate it from the normal bag.
- **Fixed**: Force field emitter and terminals used the same damage code which could lead to odd behavior.
- **Fixed**: Hero Appearance mod long hair dude pipboy image wasn't shown correctly.
- **Fixed**: Killian wouldn't mark Necropolis on the players map after asking for locations outside. 
- **Fixed**: Mantis would fight Spore Plants in encounter maps.
- **Fixed**: The "Vault 13 invasion timer bug" is no more.
- **Fixed**: The "You gain x experience points for freeing Tandi"-message will only show if the amount of experience is > 0.
- **Fixed**: The Cautious Nature perk wasn't working with the Fo1 encounter system.
- **Fixed**: When doing caravan jobs, the Caravan Driver and Caravan Guards would spawn new items on every game tick.
- **Tweaked**: Added back in the "Decker must be killed"-condition to the Hub good ending.
- **Tweaked**: All caravan jobs will only have one possible encounter now to circumvent an annoying bug that can't be fixed right now.
- **Tweaked**: Complete quest and dialog overhaul for getting the motorcycle. It's now more streamlined and relies less on meta-knowledge.
- **Tweaked**: Fixed up some more town reputation changes. Just statistics - has no real influence on the game itself.
- **Tweaked**: Increased the chance for cave and mine encounters a bit.
- **Tweaked**: Killing a Mantis now gives neutral karma (animals aren't "evil").
- **Tweaked**: Necropolis invasion mutants won't be influenced by the new "Tough Mutants" setting to keep early game balance intact.
- **Tweaked**: Removed excess items (stimpaks, psycho, caps, etc) from Garl (was a Fixt addition that changed game balance).
- **Tweaked**: Removed weapons from Bob the pre-owned cars salesman (old Fixt addition).
- **Tweaked**: Sfall graphics mode 4 (Dx9 fullscreen) is now the new default.
- **Tweaked**: Super Mutants at the Mariposa entrance will return to their home position if the player left for longer than a day.
- **Tweaked**: With Traits and Perks and the enabled "Fast Shot Fix", it was possible to get 1 AP melee and unarmed attacks. This is now fixed - the minimum APs required for any attack are now set to 2.
