FALLOUT ET TU
-------------
Fallout to Fallout 2 engine conversion


Fallout et tu (also called Fallout 1@2, 1at2, 1in2, ...) is bringing the first Fallout game into the engine of the second one while utilizing features available in Fallout 2 wherever we can (within reason).

It is _not_ an attempt to make a 1:1 copy of the first game. Our priority while working on this project was to make it more accessible modding platform, to allow creation of more complex modifications thanks to ongoing activity within Fallout 2 modding community. If you don't mind some changes in Fallout 1 mechanics (only improvements, in our humble opinion), Fallout et tu can be your way to go!
