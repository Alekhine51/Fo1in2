# Inventory AP Costs

    Features:
      - Reduces inventory opening cost to 0 action points.
      - Doing anything in the inventory costs 2 action points.
      - Limits the Quick Pockets perk to 1 rank.
      - Works with any other Fallout 2 mod.

To use this mod, open the ddraw.ini and add "PatchFile1=mods\InventoryAPcosts" under the "PatchFile0"-line!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

If there is more than one additional mod, make sure to correctly number the "PatchFileX" entry (1, 2, 3, ...).

OR you just copy the gl_inven_ap_cost.int file into your "<Fallout2 Dir>\data\scripts\" folder and the game will recognize it as well.
