      - Reduces inventory opening cost to 0 action points.
      - Doing anything in the inventory costs 2 action points.
      - Limits the Quick Pockets perk to 1 rank.

open the ddraw.ini and add "PatchFile1=mods\InventoryAPcosts"!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

To install the mod for vanilla Fallout 2, just copy the gl_inven_ap_cost.int file into your "<Fallout2 Dir>\data\scripts\" folder.
