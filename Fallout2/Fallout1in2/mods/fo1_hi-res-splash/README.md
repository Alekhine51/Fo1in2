Hi-Res Splash Screens
------------------
 
The original splash screens of Fallout 1 (and 2) come in a resolution of 640x480px. This mod adds rescaled and touched up variants of the originals in 1024x768px, and even 1280x960px resolutions to the game.

To use this mod, open the ddraw.ini and add "PatchFile1=mods\fo1_hi-res-splash" under the "PatchFile0"-line!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

If there is more than one additional mod, make sure to correctly number the "PatchFileX" entry (1, 2, 3, ...).
