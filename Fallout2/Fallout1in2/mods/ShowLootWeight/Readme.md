Show Loot Weight
------------------

This mod adds a lightweight current/max carry weight indicator to the looting and stealing interface.
Should not be used in combination with the Inventory Filter mod. While the mods shouldn't conflict, it would be redundant. 

### Installation
To use this mod, open the ddraw.ini, go to [ExtraPatches] and add "PatchFile[number]=mods\ShowLootWeight" at the end of the "PatchFile"-list!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

If there is more than one additional mod, make sure to correctly number the "PatchFileX" entry (1, 2, 3, ...).
