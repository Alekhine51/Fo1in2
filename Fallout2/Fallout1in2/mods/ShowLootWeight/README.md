Show Loot Weight
----------------

This mod adds a lightweight current/max carry weight indicator to the looting and stealing interface.

This mod is compatible with any FALLOUT 2 mod as long as it uses the latest Sfall release. However, it should not be used in combination with the Inventory Filter mod as it offers a similar feature and more.

### Installation
To use this mod, open the ddraw.ini, go to [ExtraPatches] and add "PatchFile[number]=mods\ShowLootWeight" at the end of the "PatchFile"-list!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

If there is more than one additional mod, make sure to correctly number the "PatchFileX" entry (1, 2, 3, ...).
