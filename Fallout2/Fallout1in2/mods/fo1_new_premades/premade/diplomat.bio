PERSONAL BIO DATA:

Louis Krawczuk is a
misanthrope and one
of the Vault's most 
accomplished medical
professionals. Early onset
of baldness and myopia
made him stand out in the
crowds, making him seek
adventure alone in the
underbelly of the Vault.
He hopes that by leaving
the Vault he'll force his
peers to respect him,
and more importantly,
get away from the sneers
of model citizens who
never gave him a fair
chance.
