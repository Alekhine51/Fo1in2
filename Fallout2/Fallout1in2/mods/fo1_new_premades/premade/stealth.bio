PERSONAL BIO DATA:

Sarah Asturias worked
with electricity all
her life, from the young 
age of three. A freak
accident with a power
conduit left her with
loss of motor control
in the left hand, but
it never stopped her:
She studied and practised
until she became a master
with her right hand, 
whether it be tools or
pistols. With a knack for
picking up skills and
developing them, she is
eager to put them to
test outside the Vault.
