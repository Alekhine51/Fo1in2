Improved Death Animations - Animation Fix
-----------------

This mod increases the size of the "flame boy" and "electrocuted" death animation for super mutant (120%) and power armor (larger than normal, but smaller than mutant-size) critters to match their normal scale.

Originally made by .Pixote. and Sduibek. The animations have been polished up some more and are now cleaner and less pixelated.

### Installation
To use this mod, open the ddraw.ini, go to [ExtraPatches] and add "PatchFile[number]=mods\Anim_ImprovedSMutantDeath" at the end of the "PatchFile"-list!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

If there is more than one additional mod, make sure to correctly number the "PatchFileX" entry (1, 2, 3, ...).
