Fallout 1 Maps - Mountains
------------------

This mod increases the visible area of the mountain encounter maps to support a resolution of 1280x720px without showing black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. 

Of course the new maps are also working in higher screen resolutions - in that case the black bars will be visible again, just not as big as originally. 

### Installation
To use this mod, open the ddraw.ini, go to [ExtraPatches] and add "PatchFile[number]=mods\fo1_maps_mountains" at the end of the "PatchFile"-list!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

If there is more than one additional mod, make sure to correctly number the "PatchFileX" entry (1, 2, 3, ...).
