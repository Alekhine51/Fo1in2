PERSONAL BIO DATA:

Known and feared as an
explosives expert,
Kenneth Glade always
felt restricted by the 
Vault's confined 
environments. The feeling
intensified after he was
banned from further
experiments after nearly
blowing up the Vault's
hydroponics. The Overseer
may be trying to get rid
of Ken and set him loose
for the safety of the
Vault. Ken doesn't mind,
he's  looking forward to
new proving grounds for
his devices.
