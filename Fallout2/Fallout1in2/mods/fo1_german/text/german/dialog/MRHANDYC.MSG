{119}{}{This Mr. Handy robot is in moderate condition, but appears fully functional.}

{124}{}{Hold off on that for a moment. What functions can you perform?}
{125}{}{Unit #462 assists with duties as specified by memory files and programming.}
{126}{}{Yeah, yeah, skip to the interesting parts.}
{127}{}{Could you be more specific?}
{128}{}{[Click] Unit #462 can perform nuclear reactor fuel core replacements, hazardous materials cleanup, radiation cleansing, and basic mechanical repair procedures.}
{129}{}{Anything else?}
{130}{}{[Beep!] Unit #462 is also equipped with self-maintenance routines, self-defense mechanisms, and a fully customizable operating system.}

{132}{}{Okay, thanks.}

Rest assured, Mr. Handy is the best and safety investment your family will ever make." (The speaker shuts off.)}

{139}{}{Hmm. I could use some help cleaning up this place, if you get my drift. Could you help me out?}
{140}{}{Can the self-defense system be reprogrammed into a combat system?}
