Interface Upscaled
------------------

## Features:
- Higher resolution Town/World graphics for Fallout et Tu and vanilla Fallout 2.
- Higher resolution endgame slides for Fallout et Tu and vanilla Fallout 2.
- Higher resolution death screen (the Fallout 2 graphic is in /INTRFACE/Fallout2/ and must be manually moved into the /INTRFACE/ folder of this mod).
- Higher resolution splash screens (the Fallout 2 graphics are in /SPLASH/Fallout2/ and must be manually moved into the /SPLASH/ folder of this mod).
- Works with any other Fallout 2 mod (eg. Restoration Project).

## NOTE:
- "ExpandWorldMap" in the ddraw.ini file must be set to 1, otherwise the game will crash!

### Installation
To use this mod, open the ddraw.ini, go to [ExtraPatches] and add "PatchFile[number]=mods\InterfaceUpscaled" at the end of the "PatchFile"-list!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.

If there is more than one additional mod, make sure to correctly number the "PatchFileX" entry (1, 2, 3, ...).
