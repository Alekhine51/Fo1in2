# FALLOUT ET TU

This project brings the first FALLOUT 1 into the engine of FALLOUT 2.

## Features
- Replicates FALLOUT 1 in 2 almost 1:1.
- Comes with the Hero Appearance mod integrated (Bald Dude, Long Hair Dude, Black Dude, Punk Girl).
- FALLOUT 2 styled merchant inventory restocking.
- Party members and generic NPCs can be pushed out of the way.
- Party members level up and change their appearance based on worn armor.
- Party members can be controlled in combat.
- Automatic door opening and closing.
- Traverse the wastes on your very own motorcycle!
- Selected FALLOUT 2 weapons have been added (sparingly!) to the game world in ways that don't break the game balance.
- Weapons can be upgraded in FALLOUT 2 style.
- Explore classic FALLOUT 2 style cavern and new mining site encounter maps.
- Stumble over FALLOUT 2 critters such as Geckos in encounter maps.
- The original endgame is too easy? Try the new tougher mutants setting!
- Continue playing after the main story has been completed.
- Lots of bugfixes, making the game run more stable than even the original with patches.

Most of these features are optional and can be toggled on and off via a dedicated configuration file.

Additionally, due to the more accessible modding features of FALLOUT 2, this project allows the creation of complex modifications, which wouldn't be possible with the engine of the first game!
